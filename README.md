### What I'm Currently Working On

* **Laravel-based Management Systems**: I'm actively developing **Laravel applications** for practical needs, including a robust **gym management system** and other generic administrative tools. My focus is on creating efficient, scalable, and user-friendly solutions.
* **Smart Weather Station**: I'm building a **weather station** project from the ground up, integrating **Arduino** for sensor data collection, **MQTT** for real-time communication, and a **Go-powered data pump** for efficient data handling. The data will be visualized on a **dashboard** built with either **React or Svelte**, exploring modern front-end frameworks.
* **AI & Deep Learning Exploration**: I'm deeply engaged in **Deep Learning**, with ongoing projects focusing on complex tasks like **mole detection** and developing sophisticated **LLM (Large Language Model) agents**. I'm constantly learning and experimenting with the latest advancements in AI.
* **Android Malware Research**: I'm actively researching **Android malware**, delving into techniques for **static and dynamic analysis**, reverse engineering APKs, and identifying malicious behaviors. This includes exploring tools like MobSF, JADX, and Frida to understand threats and develop detection strategies.
